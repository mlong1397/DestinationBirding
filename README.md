## Predicting When and Where to Go Birding

=========================

### Project Overview

This is the repository for the Destination Birding R Shiny App. The project is
about birding in Knox County, Tennessee. The app has a species diversity map, a
species-specific time series analysis, and a map & graph that show when and
where the best times and spots are for looking for a specific bird species.
Please view the app [here](https://mlong1397.shinyapps.io/DestinationBirding/).

I also wrote a report detailing the thought behind the app and give code
explanations in the DestinationBirdingReport.Rmd and .html files.
